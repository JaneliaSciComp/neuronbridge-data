### Release Version: 2.1.1

### Release Date: 2020-11-03

### Notes

* Fixed the merge process. There was a bug which favored matches with higher pixel score
while merging results from EM-vs-MCFO with the results from EM-vs-SGal4 instead of the matches 
with a higher normalized gradient score. This led to a wrong ranking of the final results.

### Release Version: 1.1.0

### Release Date: 2020-04-15

### Notes
* Precomputed matches between Flylight Split GAL4 and MCFO vs Hemibrain 1.0.1
* Created the segmentation for Flylight Split GAL4 and MCFO libraries and
the color depth search between hemibrain neurons and flylight was actually run
using the segmented MIPs
* For Hemibrain neurons which cross the middle section also
generated the flipped neuron by mirroring it and adding the original
and also compared this against all flylight MIPs.
* For calculating the negative scores - gradient area gap 
and the area of regions with high expression - we selected the MIPs for the top 300 lines
and we used precomnputed RGB masks generated with a radius of 20px
